# Mike-Crack
Creating the best webpage with a group of friends in Fall 2022 <br> 
Readme written by Gaspar-Jun Efondo <br> 
Kudos to Brian Nguyen, Tiffany Lovely, and Josan Sanchez as fellow programmers learning to create a joint personal website <br> 
Warning: Jun's Webpage is filled with parodies and offensive language.  <br> 

<br> Enter on your accord.

# How the Avengers got together
This Webpage consisted of 5 different pages
```
    1. Main Page 
    2. Gaspar-Jun page (This was mainly a project where I could use my creative(and edgy) humor to express myself in a website.) https://renegadegasper.github.io/Mike-Crack/Gaspar-Portion/Comgit-Suicide.html
    3. Tiffany page https://renegadegasper.github.io/Mike-Crack/Tiffany-Portion/Tiffany.html
    4. Brian page https://renegadegasper.github.io/Mike-Crack/Brian-Portion/Brian-project.html
    5. Josan page 
```

There was 3 different types of rules that we ALL had to (kind of) abide
1. Reference each Others Pages and the main page
2. Explain yourself, who are you? and what do you want to show about yourself
3. Create a Menu where you can link to the other websites of our peers
4. Have fun! (You have to, please)
